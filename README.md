# Ansible Automation Proof of Concept
Ansible-POC

This evolving set of Ansible playbooks automates some common tasks. While these are ultimately very specific to our needs, there's likely something here which will be helpful to others in their situations.

A few of the things these playbooks accomplish:

- Create files and directories, set permissions and ownership.
- Modify files and insert specific content.
- Modify the login banner (message of the day).
- stop & disable firewalld service
- Install and configure third party agents
-
